However, the 911's most significant update in its sixth decade of production is the introduction of a unique gasoline-electric hybrid system. This represents an optimized version of Porsche's turbocharged six-cylinder engine with a specially developed electric motor integrated into the front axle. The combustion engine drives the rear wheels, while the electric motor activates the front wheels.The new 400-volt system is intended to generate its own energy reserves by having the motor act as a generator and using brake regeneration to make external charging unnecessary.
